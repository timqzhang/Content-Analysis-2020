We can learn prompt types and compute types for each utterance in the corpus using ConvoKit's PromptTypeWrapper class (which implements an end-to-end pipeline that extracts prompt types; see [this notebook](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/examples/prompt-types/prompt-type-demo.ipynb) and [this notebook](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/examples/prompt-types/prompt-type-wrapper-demo.ipynb) for examples of particular steps in that pipeline). Note that in keeping with proper machine learning practices, we need a different dataset to use for training the PromptTypeWrapper object. For this, we will use Convokit's Wikipedia talk corpus (\"wiki-corpus\"), which is comprised of Wikipedia talk page conversations different from those found in the Awry corpus."

      "93369 Hi, PamD coming to chip in to the discussion. I think GENUKI is worth adding as an external link as it links to so much useful information not appropriate to be copied wholesale into WP articles, but relevant to the area and useful to some readers of WP.  I created a set of 4 templates to cover the parishes of Yorkshire: I get the impression that Yorkshire is one of the more thorough areas of GENUKI, as it is certainly patchy across the country (each county being maintained by different people). It looks to me as if Lincolnshire is unusual, if not unique, in having a \\\"Holidays and Touring\\\" section with commercial links - search GENUKI on either of those words and it is conspicuously near the top among a collection of dissimilar pages!  In any case the tiny amount of commercial links in Lincolnshire does not seem to me to be an \\\"objectionalbe amount of advertising\\\", to quote [[WP:ELNO]].  I always use caps for it, but if there was a decision that it should be written as \\\"Genuki\\\", I could change the 4 templates for Yorkshire.  It would be easy to construct similar templates for other counties, on the model of the Yorkshire ones ({{tl|Genukiwry}} etc - I should possibly have used more caps in the template names, as they use the county codes WRY for West Riding of Yorkshire, etc). \n",

You yourself have said that Wikipedia guidelines dictate that we \\\"avoid weasel words where possible\\\", yet your statement that \\\"Israel is ''considered'' a liberal democracy\\\" by this one particular source (which, incidentally, I had never heard of before) is really equivalent to saying \\\"Israel is considered by some (but not necessarily others)...\\\" or \\\"Israel is considered by Freedom House (but not necessarily anyone else) to be a liberal democracy.\\\" You may not be stating it outright, but you're still employing the logic of weasel words. This is why we need a source that explicitly and directly, with citations to other reputable sources, states outright that Israel is widely and generally considered to be a liberal democracy.

There is a formal, official Code governing the proper spelling of scientific names (the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]). One of the rules is that the name of a species must agree in gender with the name of the genus. The name \\\"Pyrops\\\" is masculine, and all names in the genus must be formed to also be masculine. While it is true that nearly everyone in the world refers to the species as \\\"candelaria\\\", those folks who do so are all wrong, and their ignorance of the rule is no reason to perpetuate the misspelling. That's exactly why rules of nomenclature exist; so when there is a difference of opinion, there is one clear and definitive answer. The genus ''Pyrops'' is masculine, therefore, all the species names in the genus must also be masculine. \n",

There are some high-level qualitative differences that you might immediately see; our goal is to automatically extract a superset of these intuitive distinctions. For instance, some threads have a very linear structure, while others are flatter; to capture this difference, we might compute statistics on the distribution of in-degrees of nodes in the reply tree. We also intuit that some conversations involve a few people replying repeatedly to each other, whereas others may involve users stopping by to chime in once and then leaving; we'll later codify this difference via statistics on the indegrees and outdegrees of hypernodes (users)."
